  inspectString: "It\u2019s been three months since I sent Suzy out to find the Loadstone,
    and finally she found it, as I knew she would. This thing has apparently made
    its way around, her expedition took her and her team all around the Middle East,
    up into Pakistan and then India, made its way all the way to China where around
    the time of the Opium Wars made its way the way west to Europe and finally ended
    up inside an underwater mansion off the coast of Massachusetts. This thing really
    had a history to it, and I\u2019m confident given the nature of this thing, that
    it played a huge role in the lives of people who found it, what that role was
    however, I couldn\u2019t say.  After studying the Loadstone itself for about a
    week now I can only say is that it reads, looks and functions the same way as
    a regular Loadstone. I mean to be fair this one is definitely \u201CGreater\u201D
    in its size and the carvings on it are certainly more beautiful and ornate than
    a regular Loadstone. But as far as its functionality it just appears to be the
    same exact thing as a regular Loadstone, it generates more energy sure, but multiple
    regular Loadstone\u2019s would work just as well. So why do we even need this
    thing? I\u2019ll keep the Stone for another week, call a couple of old friends,
    gather together a couple of outside perspectives on the situation and see what
    we can conclude. "
