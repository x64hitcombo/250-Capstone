  inspectString: "Suzy came home earlier than she said would, she said she had something
    to show me, an old journal from the 1940\u2019s apparently. She told me it's what
    lead her to the Loadstone and that it contained information on things it shouldn\u2019t
    contain knowledge of at all. At her discretion I went ahead and gave the journal
    a read, I was shocked. The journal was indeed written in the 1940\u2019s yet it
    had information on Markings, Loadstones, the Greater Loadstone, and the one that
    sent a chill up my spine, the SRB machine. It didn\u2019t refer to it as the SRB,
    instead it referred to it as \u201Cthe Horrible Engine\u201D, and this journal
    had a near exact drawing and schematic on what the machine looked like, it was
    the SRB through and out.  I didn\u2019t understand, this journal was written ninety
    six years ago, ninety two years before the Saviors arrived and gave us these things.
    I read the journal in depth, into everything it had to say. Most of it talked
    about a strange cult, worshipping some sort of god that was meant to come out
    of the machine and dominate or destroy humanity. The journal also had a drawing
    of a Marking in it and described what they can do perfectly, except for one additional
    thing, it says they can drive the person who's been Marked insane. And that those
    who are marked go on to serve the god that comes out of the machine. It all seems
    like nonsense and is probably just superstitious nonsense but there was no denying
    that the journal had completely accurate information on everything. Meaning the
    Saviors have been lying to us in one way or another, and they can no longer be
    trusted.  In his journal Dick Tracey mentions that he encountered people who had
    been marked, who later died after they activated their machine. Its from that
    line, that I\u2019m afraid what we\u2019re building at the lab, is some kind of
    weapon, a weapon that the saviors are for some reason trying to trick us into
    building. Maybe it's not a god that comes out of the machine, but maybe an alien
    instead, it is supposed to be a spatial teleporter, maybe, maybe it's a plan for
    an invasion. It makes sense, assuming this journal is genuine, then I might be
    building the very weapon that dooms humanity. I need to think about all of this,
    I should also probably tell Luther and see what he thinks, together we can probably
    figure this out. "
