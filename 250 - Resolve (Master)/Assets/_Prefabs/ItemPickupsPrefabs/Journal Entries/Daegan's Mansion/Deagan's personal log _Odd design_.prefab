  inspectString: "I\u2019ve been looking at all of the designs for this machine and
    \ I have to say, while it's one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever studied,
    I also find it strange. Unlike other Hy-Tec devices this machine is absolutely
    massive, we ended up having to buy a whole mountain to build the thing under in
    order to hide and secure it. And while I\u2019m sure a machine as complicated
    as this one is would require a lot of power I still find it odd how a single Loadstone
    powers this thing. I\u2019ve studied the Loadstones the Saviors have given to
    us in the past and I just can\u2019t understand these things, they defy the basic
    laws of thermodynamics and are able to somehow power certain, specific Hy-Tec
    devices without any indication on where the energy is actually coming from within
    the Stone. And now suddenly we\u2019re being sent to find a supposedly bigger
    greater Loadstone that the Saviors sent to Earth thousands of years ago. It\u2019s
    illogical to me, and I understand that the Saviors are aliens, but i have to believe
    that there's some sort of universal concept of logic, all of nature abides by
    it in some way right? Why did they send the battery for a teleportation device
    to us millenia ago and then wait so long before coming after it? It\u2019s bizarre
    to me and my gut is shouting at me about it and I\u2019ve learned to trust my
    gut. We have no idea where the Stone is exactly, all the Saviors have been able
    to tell us about it, is that it would have landed somewhere in Iraq, which just
    so happens to also be the cradle of civilization. I want someone I can trust to
    go find this thing and bring it back, I want to examine this thing for myself
    before anyone else can, I\u2019ll delay the construction on the parts of the machine
    that involve the Loadstone, that way I can take some time to study it for myself.
    But before that I need someone to actually go find it, and luckily, I\u2019m married
    to the perfect someone."
