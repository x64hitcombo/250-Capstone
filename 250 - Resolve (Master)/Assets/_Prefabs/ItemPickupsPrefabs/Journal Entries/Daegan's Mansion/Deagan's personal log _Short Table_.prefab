  inspectString: "I did it, I gathered a small team together I both need and could
    absolutely trust. My wife Suzy, Luther, Dr. Salt, and Dr.Eng Fauntain. I\u2019ve
    known each a long time and trust them each with my life. Suzy and I explained
    it to the others, it took some time but we were eventually able to convince them
    of the truth, the Saviors are lying to us, that everything they told us about
    themselves and the Marks was a lie. Our Marks aren\u2019t gifts, they\u2019re
    chains, and  they\u2019re gonna be the death of us. The Saviors don\u2019t want
    to help us, they want to serve us to some, monster. That we knew it was hard to
    believe, but it\u2019s the only thing that somehow makes sense. That machine we\u2019re
    building, the SRB, or as the book called it, the Horrible Engine! It\u2019s a
    trap, and if we don\u2019t do something then whatever comes crawling out of that
    machine is going to decimate humanity. I can\u2019t just destroy the machine,
    if I do the Saviors will see and suspect I know something. They might even take
    the plans and give them to someone else to build cutting us out entirely. No,
    if we do something about this then we\u2019ll have to do it in secret. No one
    can know what we\u2019re planning. We spent the rest of the night coming up with
    a plan, it was complicated and a little convoluted, but it's our best bet.  The
    Saviors recently told the world that they were leaving soon, and that when they
    did it would be with one final gift. That gift is supposed to be the SRB, it just
    supports the claim that the machine has some sort of ill intention behind it,
    but it's also a good thing. The Saviors won\u2019t leave until the machine is
    turned on for the first time, meaning that we\u2019re gonna have to turn it on
    no matter what, because if we do anything to the machine before that then the
    Saviors will intervene. But once its activated the Saviors won\u2019t have anything
    keeping them here, and that's when they intend to leave. They probably wouldn\u2019t
    leave unless they knew we wouldn\u2019t be able to turn it off once they were
    gone. The Greater Loadstone is what powers the machine, as far as I can tell the
    thing is practically indestructible. But the machine is and the Saviors wouldn\u2019t
    be planning on us knowing what we know. With the help of Elliott, he and I will
    sabotage the machine to blow once the Saviors have left. The journal also made
    mention how the Stones effects can be reversed by applying energy to the right
    spots of the Stone. So we\u2019ll have the machine send an overload to the Stone
    to undo or destroy whatever the machine creates and then have it blow itself to
    bits. Luther will continue to act as our representative to the Saviors as he always
    has, and make sure they believe everything is going exactly the way they want
    it to.  But there is a problem, the Marks that we all so blindly received will
    drive us insane within a matter of moments after the machine is activated, meaning
    if something goes wrong none of us will be able to do anything, because we\u2019ll
    all either be dead or mentally incapable of helping. That\u2019s finally where
    Dr. Salt comes in, I\u2019ll give her a private lab I bought years ago and have
    her turn it into a cloning facility, if something goes wrong, we\u2019re gonna
    need someone who can go and fix the machine. The clone is only a backup plan and
    hopefully it won\u2019t need to be utilized. Everyone in the world who is marked
    will die when this machine is destroyed, that's what the journal said. Those who
    are unmarked will survive however, the road ahead for them will be tough, but
    humanity will survive. "
