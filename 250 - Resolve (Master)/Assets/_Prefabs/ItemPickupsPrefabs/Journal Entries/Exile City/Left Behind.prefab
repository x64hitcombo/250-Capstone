    them, howling and snarling, they were hungry, they needed to eat, and there we
    were out in the open. he tried to fend them off but they weren\u2019t frightened
    by him, animals aren\u2019t scared when they\u2019re hungry. They got him, one
    moment he was standing right in front of me and the next he was on the ground
    being eaten alive. I\u2019m still haunted by his screams, the sounds he made as
    they tore into him and ripped him apart. Next thing I knew I was running, running,
    running, running, for so long I  was running, I couldn\u2019t even think, all
    I could do was run, run, run, run, run.  I don't remember where I dropped the
    bag of supplies I had on me, next to his corpse before I ran? Somewhere amongst
    all that running? I need to find it, it had the only picture of him I have left
    of him. In order to find it I\u2019ll have to go back to (location), right where
    he died, I need to find that bag."
