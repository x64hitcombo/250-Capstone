  inspectString: "Julian, you sent me to Killenton to see if the stories we\u2019ve
    been hearing about this place were true, and sadly, they are. I don\u2019t remember
    how I ended up in this maze, all I remember is going to sleep for the night, safe
    outside the town, but when I woke up I was lying in the middle of an old church.
    The town has been turned into an elaborate maze filled with traps, Mad Men, and
    dead corpses. This so called Priest of Faces appears to be the creator of this
    maze, I would say he\u2019s a Mad Man himself, but he acts with logic and intelligence.
    Whatever he is, the man is definitely crazy. He\u2019s been taunting and screaming
    at me to \u201Ccome find him\u201D over some elaborate PA system he has rigged
    throughout the town. According to his notes the only way to escape was to find
    and kill him, I did my best but while making my way throughout the maze I walked
    right into a trap that shot me right in the stomach. With no first aid and no
    doctor I most likely won\u2019t be making it back to Lake Vito. I don\u2019t think
    anyone will ever actually read this note, but in these last moments, it\u2019s
    helped to put me at ease about my situation. Julian if you do ever read this,
    then I\u2019m sorry to report my mission to be a failure. I wish I could be there
    when you guys finally close the Sky Rift, but it looks like you guys will have
    to do that without me and I hope you do, I hope you do. The Unmarked shall inherit
    the Earth! Signed - Peter Jensen "
