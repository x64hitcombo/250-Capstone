  inspectString: "Ok, this expedition has been going surprisingly smoothly, like ridiculously
    smoothly, almost as if some outside force was watching and guiding us. We\u2019ve
    been getting clues and helpful tips left and right from libraries, museums, tombs,
    temples; it\u2019s an almost endless line of clue after clue. I\u2019ll be pissed
    if it turns out the Saviors know where the Stone is but are purposefully withholding
    that information just so they can watch us go on this wild goose chase. Either
    way we didn\u2019t spend much time in Baghdad, just like I predicted. We ended
    up finding a hint about the Stone in some Assyrian Text, This Stone has an impressive
    history, it\u2019s somehow managed to make its way to almost everywhere in the
    world. Our journey ended up taking us all around the middle east and eventually
    up along the silk road through Pakistan where it was mentioned in religious text,
    then to India where we found a temple that once supposedly housed the Stone, not
    there now though. Eventually we got to China, where we found mentions of a strange
    cult that apparently worshipped the thing, also had an affection for tentacles,
    had lots of drawings of tentacles in general. From here the stone seems to depart
    from china after the First Opium War, from there it seems to have made its way
    all the way to Europe. We\u2019re on a red eye flight now to London, where we\u2019ll
    pick up with the investigation. It hasn\u2019t even been two months and we\u2019ve
    already made so much progress, crossing my fingers that our luck stays true."
