  inspectString: "We found it, our journey lead us from Europe to the United States
    where we got a major lead on where to find the Stone, and we found it. We oddly
    enough found it inside a large underwater mansion off the coast of Massachusetts.
    The house, along with the cliff it sat on, collapsed into the ocean almost a century
    ago after some big earthquake rocked the region. We hired a diving crew to go
    down and retrieve the Stone and had it sent back to Daegan ahead of us, we\u2019ll
    be following suit in a week once we wrap up here in Boston.  \tWhat originally
    turned us onto the Stones location was a journal kept by a detective named Dick
    Tracey. The journal details a case that he worked on revolving around the mansion
    just before it collapsed into the ocean. While we\u2019ve been wrapping up I\u2019ve
    taken the time to dive into the journal and see what happened. Needless to say
    I\u2019m absolutely terrified, the journal detailed a case revolving around people
    who had been going missing in the area near the mansion. Apparently a cult of
    fenatics (perhaps the same cult we found hints of in China) were kidnapping people
    and sacrificing them to the Stone. But that's not what terrified me, what terrified
    me was what the cultists were attempting to build around the Stone. The journal
    featured an elaborate schematic (presumably drawn by the cultists or Dick himself)
    of a machine that the cultists were attempting to build, it looks exactly like
    the machine my husband is building. At first I figured I was mistaken, I\u2019m
    not an expert on schematics so it was entirely possible I was mistaken. But then
    I found a drawing in the journal that shook me the second I saw it, it was a drawing
    of a Mark. How could that be? The journal and the case date back to the late 1940\u2019s
    , well before the Saviors arrived on Earth. Yet here they were drawn and described
    to the T in this journal. Marks of Madness it calls them, giving people enhanced
    physical attributes all while slowly driving the bearer of the Mark insane over
    multiple years. The journal even described normal Loadstones and what they\u2019re
    used for, exactly the same as the ones the Saviors gave us. The Saviors are lying
    to us, either about when they actually came to Earth for the first time and/or
    about their true intentions. I need to get this journal back to my husband as
    soon as possible, I need him to see this for himself and see if he reaches the
    same conclusion as I did. "
