  inspectString: "I...I don\u2019t know what I just saw, I don\u2019t understand what's
    happening. I just witnessed the most bizarre and frightening thing I have ever
    seen. We saw a massive explosion in the distance, it was the DD facility. We saw
    a massive beam of light shoot into the sky, and it tore the sky apart, as if it
    were a curtain on a stage, and then, of all things, monsters came pouring out
    of it. Thousands of these grotesque, ugly, green monsters came through it, they
    started flying in every direction. It looked like an alien invasion, I can\u2019t
    believe I actually said that, an alien invasion! what the hell am I supposed to
    do about that? And the tentacle, along with the monsters a giant tentacle came
    through the tear, followed by more tentacles and eventually a face, a face of
    a large monster with a squid looking kind of head, it felt like all the blood
    drained from my body when I saw that thing for the first time. And then another
    beam of light came from the facility and closed the tear, cutting off the flow
    of tiny monsters and one their mother monster\u2019s giant tentacles,  And the
    tear, it's still in the sky, just hanging there like a lightning bolt stuck frozen
    in the sky, with the second beam of light from the facility is still moving back
    and forth across it. I have no idea what to do, I feel stunned, I can\u2019t think
    of how to respond to what I saw or what to do. Thousands of those monsters came
    through, I don\u2019t know what they want but they didn\u2019t look friendly.
    Until we know more I\u2019ve ordered everyone into the deeper tunnels and we\u2019re
    barring the entrance."
