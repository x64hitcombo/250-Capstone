  inspectString: "We were right, all this time we were right about the Markings. We\u2019ve
    finally after three day have been able to establish contact with some of our agents,
    many are still MIA. They\u2019ve reported  that the sickness appears to only be
    affecting people who have been marked, and that the monster aliens are indeed
    ignoring them and going after these who haven\u2019t already been marked. These
    monsters, people are saying they can\u2019t be killed, they\u2019ve supposedly
    already wiped out entire armies, governments are starting to fall, and that crack
    in the sky over the DD facility is still there, it\u2019s the apocalypse. The
    Saviors, they were planning this all along, the Marks, that crack in the sky,
    those monsters. They\u2019re not Saviors, they\u2019re Conquerors, probably sitting
    on their ship in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, watching in entertainment as the world
    burns. This is big even for me, I don\u2019t know what we can do because as of
    right now, humanity has lost. But we have to try, there's still a lot of humanity
    left and who knows maybe whatever's afflicting these people can be cured. I have
    to believe that we can actually do something about this, we can still destroy
    that facility, maybe if we\u2019re lucky we can remove that crack in the sky and
    maybe all of this will end. Or if not, then we\u2019ll die fighting every one
    of them, we\u2019re not just fighting for our freedom anymore, now we\u2019re
    fighting for the survival of the entire human race."
